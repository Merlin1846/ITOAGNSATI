ITOAGNSATI (I.Couldn't.Think.Of.A.Good.Name.So.Acronym.It.Is) pronounced ee-toe-ag-sat-ee is an incredibly simple programming language, with the first version being done in a single night on 11/18/2021. If you want to see documentation on each command check out the DOCUMENTATION.txt if you want to see some example programs check out the Examples directory. If you want to learn how to use the compiler then continue reading.

Luckily for anyone in existence that hates trying to fix compilers for three days straight, the ITOAGNSATI compiler is incredibly simple to use. All you have to do is open up your terminal in the same directory as the compilers binary and run "./itoagnsati-compiler sourceFile.txt targetFile.rs" this will run the compiler. It will then compile the first argument "sourceFile.txt" and output a file with a similar name to the second argument "targetFile.rs". In this case, the output file will be named "targetFile" and can be executed using "./targetFile" because of this two-argument system there is no need to mess around with compiler settings since there aren't any.
